## About

The Diamond Price Prediction project utilizes a dataset containing information about thousands of diamonds. By analyzing this dataset and training a machine learning model, the project aims to provide accurate predictions of diamond prices based on their characteristics.

The goal of this project is to showcase the process of building a predictive model using machine learning techniques. It serves as a learning resource for individuals interested in understanding the steps involved in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available in the `dataset` directory. It includes various attributes of diamonds, such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and price. The dataset is in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.
